                <p class="text-left text-muted"> A big complex with 19 Grass Champion Courts, 22 grass practice courts, and 8 American clay courts. I went to watch my favorite player Roger Federer play when I went to London. It was a absouloute amazing expierence! I even had lunch with one of the world's most famous chefs! I even got to watch two female matches. The view was amazing and I could see the tennis players clearly. If you go, you should definetly watch a match on centre court because you are guarenteed to watch some good players play tennis. Finally, centre court in my opinion is the court with the best seats! Go visit Wimbledon in the United Kingdom now!

                <p class="text-left text-muted"> A big wall with many drawings and sadly, a huge tragedy happened here, However, I really liked the art pieces on the walls. They were all so beautiful and some were cool rather than beautiful. I even went to a shop nearby and got a piece of the Berlin Wall because it is all in pieces. It is super fun to go there and you can learn a lot about Germany. Go visit the Berlin Wall in Germany now!</p>

                    This movie is a thriller and you should watch it immediately. I named my dog after the main charcter in this movie (Simba) so I can assure you that it is awesome. The characters come to life and the voice is all really smooth. It is about Lion prince Simba and his father are targeted by his bitter uncle, who wants to ascend the throne himself. There are some scary parts, but don't be afraid. This movie is suitable for all kids and adults, even grandparents. It is one of my favorite movies, if not, my favorite. Watch the Lion King now!

                    Cruella is a great movie a follow up movie about how Cruella because so dark in 101 dalmatians. It is an awesome movie but misses one star due to it's cast. The cast is awesome but sometimes doens't bring the full emotion into whatever they say. This is what Cruella is about: Before she became known as a criminal with a savage affinity for dog-skin clothing, CRUELLA de Vil was known as Estella, an orphaned girl living on the streets of London in the early 1970s, getting by on petty thefts and creative costumes. Her luck turns after she becomes an apprentice to London's most in-demand fashion designer, Baroness von Hellman. But just when it seems Estella's dreams are about to come true, she's confronted by her tragic past.

                    Peter Rabbit is an awesome movie that I would give fiev stars. It is great quality and the characters come to life really well. What it is about: Peter and his family are without parents thanks to mean Old Mr. McGregor. So the young rabbits regularly break into his garden to steal vegetables. Then one day, Mr. McGregor dies suddenly, so all the local animals take over his house. But a distant nephew, Thomas McGregor , gets word of his inheritance and, hoping to sell the farm and open a toy store in London, decides to check it out. He meets pretty, bunny-loving neighbor/artist, Bea. Determined not to let her know about his deep-seated anger issues, he puts on an easygoing facade -- all the while trying to get rid of the rabbits (permanently) without her knowing. Peter, in turn, wants Thomas to go away, so he plays all manner of vicious tricks on him. Eventually, the situation literally becomes explosive.

                    To be enviromentally responsible, scientists created artificial photosynthesis. Artificial photosynthesis aims to split water in oceans, and possibly even rivers, into its hydrogen, oxygen, and carbon components using sunlight. Hydrogen produced via AP is readily usable in the fuel cells of electric cars being manufactured right now, and it can also be used to store solar energy. Peidong Yang discovered this and we have made even more progress with it right now in 2021. Artificial Photosynthesis can also be called AP and it is extremely important in everbody's future.

                    Ice Caps are melting all across the world and we need to stop this right now. Why?
                    If all the ice covering Antarctica , Greenland, and in mountain glaciers around the world were to melt, sea level would rise about 70 meters (230 feet). The ocean would cover all the coastal cities. And land area would shrink significantly. But many cities, such as Denver, would survive. Arctic sea ice keeps the polar regions cool and helps moderate global climate. Sea ice has a bright surface; 80 percent of the sunlight that strikes it is reflected back into space. As sea ice melts in the summer, it exposes the dark ocean surface. We need to stop ice caps from melting now!

                            The second instalment of boy wizard Harry Potter's adventures at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, based on the novel by JK Rowling. A mysterious elf tells Harry to expect trouble during his second year at Hogwarts, but nothing can prepare him for trees that fight back, flying cars, spiders that talk and deadly warnings written in blood on the walls of the school. Harry enters a secritive chamber (Young Voldemort is in it; his chamber) through a bathroom and finds a Basilisk tooth. He then destroys Voldemort's book with that tooth and that eliminates a horcrux. Read to find out more!

                        An 11-year-old boy living in Memphis in 1959 throws the meanest fastball in town, but talking is a whole different ball game. He can barely say a word without stuttering, not even his own name. So when he takes over his best friend's paper route for the month of July, he knows he'll be forced to communicate with the different customers, including a housewife who drinks too much and a retired merchant marine who seems to know just about everything.

                        The paper route poses challenges, but it's a run-in with the neighborhood junkman, a bully and thief, that stirs up real trouble - and puts the boy's life, as well as that of his family's devoted housekeeper, in danger.

                            Eleven-year-old Melody is not like most people. She can’t walk. She can’t talk. She can’t write. All because she has cerebral palsy. But she also has a photographic memory; she can remember every detail of everything she has ever experienced. She’s the smartest kid in her whole school, but NO ONE knows it. Most people—her teachers, her doctors, her classmates—dismiss her as mentally challenged because she can’t tell them otherwise. But Melody refuses to be defined by her disability. And she’s determined to let everyone know it…somehow. Read more to find out!

                            One Crazy Summer is a children's novel and work of historical fiction by Rita Williams-Garcia. Published in 2010, this novel is the first in Williams-Garcia's Gaither Sisters series; two sequels, P.S. Be Eleven and Gone Crazy in Alabama, were published in 2013 and 2015, respectively. One Crazy Summer tells the story of sisters Delphine, Vonetta, and Fem, who spend a summer in Oakland, California as members of a day camp run by the Black Panther Party, of which their mother is a member. Though the story is a work of fiction, it takes place against the backdrop of the civil rights movement and simmering tensions that gripped the U.S. in the summer of 1968, in the aftermath of the assassination Martin Luther King, Jr. One Crazy Summer was Newbery Honor book and a National Book Award finalist, as well as the recipient of the Coretta Scott King Award and the Scott O'Dell Award for Historical Fiction.
